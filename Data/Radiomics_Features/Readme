The hippocampal radiomics features was extracted by an matlab scirpt (radiomics_main_feature.m and radiomics_main_feature_wavelet.m),
which included intensity-based features, shape-based features and texture-based features, across 8 wavelet-based frequency domains.

After redundancy removal, 431 hippocampal features were used in each hemisphere. Single hemisphere radiomics features was stored in an excel file [S1~S6, (Left or Right)]. 
N*M matrix was found in each file, the rows represent each sample, and the columns represent each feature (1-431, eg. Size, meanâ€¦). Detail defined of those features can be found in 10.1038/ncomms5006.
