# Hippocampal Radiomics Features

*The hippocampal radiomics features was extracted by an matlab scirpt (radiomics_main_feature.m and radiomics_main_feature_wavelet.m),
which included intensity-based features, shape-based features and texture-based features, across 8 wavelet-based frequency domains.

*After redundancy removal, 431 hippocampal features were used in each hemisphere. Single hemisphere radiomics features was stored in an excel file [S1~S6, (Left or Right)]. 
N*M matrix was found in each file, the rows represent each sample, and the columns represent each feature (1-431, eg. Size, meanâ€¦). Detail defined of those features can be found in 10.1038/ncomms5006. 

If you want to test your ML method with those feature, I suggest to divided the training dataset and testing dataset with center id, eg.S1-S5 as a training data, and S6 as testing data. Inter-site corss validation can support the high robustness for the classification results.

*If the detail information(eg. age, gender, MMSE, AVLT and so on) of each subject can be help for your study, you can contact Yong Liu ([yliu@nlpr.ia.ac.cn]) to apply the detail information.
